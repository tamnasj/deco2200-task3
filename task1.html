            <h1 id="part1">Introduction</h1>
            <p>This research plan identifies personal safety as a problem are and the scenario of how uncomfortable situations with an Member of Preferred Sex(MPS)
              has become normalised to women and girls. Research will be conducted to understand and provide statistical data on the probolem, while also
              looking into competitive analysis of safety applications. This will also help generate questions for the methodologies. 3 methods was conducted which
              include interviews, questionnaires and contextual observation. This is to provide qualitative data to further gain information from the public of the problem. Which
              require analysis and synthesis to unravel themes, patterns and finally how the problem can be reframed from current solutions.
            </p>

            <h2 id="part1-1">Problem Area</h2>
            <p>Following the second week, an afternoon of brainstorming, we initially came up with Social Anxiety as our problem area. However,
              we soon realized in the following week of studio how easily the topic can be overthrown by internal influences of the user such as
             changing habits,willingness of users which makes it more difficult to solve the problem later on. While also, this problem area involves
             a wide range of social factors that can intertwine with one another.</p>
             This prompt us to conduct another session of brainstorming in which we chose Personal Safety as our problem area
               <p>We identified and proposed three distinct problem areas that are often found to be
                 associated in the women's personal safety. </p>
               <ul>
                 <li><strong>Street</strong> safety</li>
                 <li><strong>Work</strong> safety</li>
                 <li>Safety with an <strong>MPS</strong> (Member of the preffered Sex)</li>
               </ul>

               <p>After much deliberation, we came to a unified agreement to focus on <strong>Safety with an MPS</strong> as the problem area</p>


            <h2 id="part1-2">Problem Scenario</h2>

            <figure class="image-container">

               <figcaption>Illustration by Skip Sterling</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The problem scenario that I have chosen is uncomfortable situations with an MPS has become a routine part of every day life. As the state does not consider
              'sexual harassment' as unlawful and an offence, the word 'uncomfortable' is then applied to generalise the indencent stigmatism of the wide range of behaviours.
              This decision to choose this scenario was based on how this problem has become normalised for women and girls to experience in their lifetime.
              Unwanted and unwelcome harassment can make a situation with an MPS uncomfortable. It is a problem that is transpiring ubiquitously, regardless of
              time or location. It enforces girls to resort with excessive precautions of one's safety as a method of prevention(what to look out for) in possible situations
              while also as a counter-response(what to do) if the incidents were to occur.

         <section class="content-container">
            <h1 id="part2">Research</h1>
            <p></p>
            <p> Sexual harassment is often overlooked in terms of severity to Sexual assault.</p>

            Firstly we will be looking into research of Sexual Assault:
            <p>
              Sexual assault is one of the major health and welfare issues in Australia. Though Sexual assault can occur to anyone of any age, race or gender, women and children are the most vulnerable. According to the Australia Bureau of Statistics (2018), 1 in every 5 women (19%) and 5% of Australian men have experienced real or threats of sexual assault. In addition, it is reported that nearly 70% of the assaults happened in private residences, followed by 10% on the streets, alleys and footpaths (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2018). Such vicious acts which totally disregard the basic respect for an individual’s body and will have not only caused emotional distress for the victims but also cost the Australian economy more than 10 billion every year to prevent and alleviate the issue (ABS 2013).
            </p>

            <p>Given the prevalence of this matter, the rate of sexual assault in the past decade shows no sign of decreasing, thereby steadily exposing the Australian community to the menace of being violated (Australian Institute of Family Studies 2019).</p>
            <p>However, the recognisiton of the 'Sexual Assault' does not apply in the same case as 'Sexual harrassment'. The lack of prevalence in severity to that of 'sexual assault' cases makes it difficult to recognise 'sexual harassment' as an issue. Based on the Australian Bureau of Statistic survey on Personal Safety (2016), One in two women had experienced sexual harassment in the course of their lifetime. To clarify, about half of Australian women have experienced sexual harassment. Girls at the age of 18 to 24 were the worst to be affected by the harassment. The persistence of these severe, pervasive and troublingly harassing behaviours often involves interaction with a Member of Preferred Sex. Unwanted and unwelcome harassment can make a situation with an MPS uncomfortable. It is a problem that is transpiring ubiquitously, regardless of time or location. It enforces girls to resort with excessive precautions of one's safety as a method of prevention(what to look out for) in possible situations while also counter-response(what to do) if the incidents were to occur.</p>

            <p>However, October 2017, marks the breakthrough in recognising 'sexual harassment' as a national problem. Efforts to recognise sexual harassment as a prominent problem in society is often argued with its prevalence.  Though, in 2017, the allegations on Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has put the harassment of women into the spotlight (Cobb.S & Horeck.T , 2018). For the first time, the topic of 'sexual harassment' gain national attention and has encouraged the creation of the #Metoo  movement. The effect has produced the prevalence of uncomfortable situations with an MPS in the public sphere. As women and girls were able to break their silence and share their experiences for the very first time since their victimisation. </p>

            <h3 id="part2-0">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>I conducted competitive analysis with existing applications available within the Australian region.
            Which include bSAfe, SafeZone, Cozy Personal Safety Recorder.</p>
            <figure class="image-container">
               <!-- Link your own images from the img folder or somewhere online -->
               <img src="img/Competitive-Analysis.png" alt="A competitive analysis table of existing safety applications" />
               <figcaption>Competitive Analysis: Women Safety Applications</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> By analysing each characteristics of the existing applications, it can be concluded that there are large room
            for improvement specifically in the accessibility of the applications. All three have obtained features that are
          useful in dire situations, however, factors such as forms of payment/monetization, limited zones and ineffective solution to invite
        close contacts has hindered these applications to be a reliable device when met with uncomfortable situations.</p>

            <h2 id="part2-1">Methods</h2>
            <p ALIGN=center>The overall aim of this research plan is to identify  the safety precautions women would
            practice if they were to expereince an uncomfortable situation with an MPS</p>

            <p>Three methods were utlised to gain further traction of the chosen scenario, this is to allow
                further examination and exploration to the understandings and experiences of uncomfortable situations
                and how women has adopted/practiced safety precautions if they were to experience the situation with an
                MPS.
            </p>
            <ol>
               <li>Interviews</li>
               <li>Questionnaires</li>
               <li>Contextual Observation</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Due to the intimate/personal nature of the problem scenario, consent forms and anonymity are
                required before conducting the methods.
            </p>

            <h3 id="part2-1-1">Interviews</h3>
            <p>Interviews enables the ability to identify areas of design interest from the participant's perception.</p>
            <figure class="image-container">
               <img src="img/woment-tgt.jpg" alt="Young woman comforted by her friend" />
               <figcaption>Illustration by Teo Bichinashvili</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The goal of the interview is:</p>
            <p ALIGN=CENTER><strong><em><q>To learn how women and girls acquire methods of prevention (what they look out for) in possible situations while also counter-response(what to do) if the incidents were to occur.</q></em></strong></p>
            <p>Specifically due to the sensitive nature of the problem scenario, the interview is structured to
            give the absolute precedence for participants to voice their thoughts, feelings and experiences towards the situation. This is intended to encourage the participants to
          respond as openly as possible while also maintaining a comfortable and safe space during the interview.</p>

              <p>A total of 10 participants agreed to partake in the interview, six of whom were interviewed
                face to face while the next four was interviewed through Skype.</p>

              <p>The duration of the interviews were 6 - 20 minutes long. In which the following
              question was asked and divided into four themes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Circumstances that influences personal safety</strong>
                  <ul>
                  <li>How often do you think about your safety?</li>
                  <li>Why do you think personal safety is important?</li>
                  <li>What factors do you think influences your safety the most?</li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li><strong>Current available safety resources</strong>
                  <ul>
                  <li>What resources do you use to learn more about personal safety?</li>
                  <li>Who do you think are the most dependable in gaining knowledge about safety measures?</li>
                  </ul>

                  <li><strong>Experience and precautions to uncomfortable situations</strong>
                  <ul>
                  <li>What do you consider to be an uncomfortable situation?</li>
                  <li>If you were to experience an uncomfortable situation.
                      What would you plan to do next to get you out of the situation?</li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li><strong>Awareness and suggested useful features, role of technology</strong>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Do you believe technology can play a vital role in getting you out of uncomfortable situations? Why?</li>
                  <li>Are you aware of existing applications that can help protect your personal safety?
                  if yes, which existing applications have you found to be helpful?</li>
                  <li>If there is a newly developed application that can assist in helping you
                  cope with these potential situations, would you download it?</li>
                  <li>What features would you look out for?</li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Participant self-reflection</strong>
                  <ul>
                  <li>What advice would you say to someone who never experience an uncomfortable
                  situation?</li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>

            <h3 id="part2-1-2">Questionnaires</h3>

            <figure class="image-container">
               <img src="img/Qheading.png" alt="A girl filling a questionnaire" />
            </figure>

            <p>Questionnaires are the most accessible quanitative research method and are great tools to validate qualitative findings (Moran, 2018).
            By doing the one-on-one interviews first-hand creates a base foundation to identify the key areas of interest of the probolem scenario
            and utilising the flexibility of questionnaires as the second methodology will assist in diving deeper into the themes gained from the interviews.
            To further assert the target audience, the questionnaires will be sent out to females at the age of 18-25 year-old and quantitative data
            will be gained from different responses methods such as multiple-choice, scale rating, checkboxes and also open-ended questions in regards to
            providing reasons for the participants choices.</p>

            <p align=CENTER>12 questions was published and here are the findings:</p>

            <figure class="image-container">
               <img src="img/Q1Q2.png" alt="Q1" />

            </figure>

            <p>The questionnaire was conducted with the assistance of 30 participants, whose ages range from 18 to 25. Whilst most users believe personal
              safety is essential, it appears that the majority do not have a frequent thought about this matter. In particular, 'sometimes' catered the
              most scores at 36.7% (11 users) whereas 'always' only accumulate an overall of 23.3% (7 users).</p>

            <figure class="image-container">
               <img src="img/Q3.png" alt="Q3" />
            </figure>

            <p>In addition, it is crucial to identify potential circumstances that influence the practice of safety precautions as these play a key role in gaining
             a better insight about external factors that are associated with safety. In regards to this, 'being alone' amasses the highest response rate with 23
             participants, followed by gut feeling (21), location (20) and time (15). 'Being alone', 'gut feeling' and 'location' are then identified to be the main
            factors that can influence an individual to practice safety precautions.</p>

            <figure class="image-container">
               <img src="img/Q4Q5.png" alt="Q4Q5" />
            </figure>

            <p>Unsurprisingly, most users find their safety to be the most vulnerable during the darkness timeframe. Due to the nature of uncomfortable situations occurring ubiquitously,
            the question provides a variety of places that the users can choose.These examples were made available to explore which environment may trigger individual safety signals. Furthermore, participants indicate dark alleys, public
            transport and empty streets as the top 3 scenes to act on one's safety measures. Interestingly, this aligns with what was found by the 2018 report conducted by
            the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on sexual assault, in which the majority of the assaults occur when the victims are alone on empty streets.


            <figure class="image-container">
               <img src="img/Q6.png" alt="Q6" />
            </figure>

            <p>For the purpose of this research, identifying the most reliable agent in gaining knowledge of safety is one of the paramount priorities as this will unravel and
              identify which agents the user will seek advice when it comes to safety. As displayed on the pie chart, the most dependable in obtaining information on safety
              precautions are 'friends' and 'users’ own experience'.Despite 'friends' and drawing their 'own experiences' being deemed as the most reliable agents.</p>

              <figure class="image-container">
                 <img src="img/Q7.png" alt="Q7" />
              </figure>

              <p>browsing online is also another popular response. Specifically, users are highly aware of available safety
                resources online as 26 out of 30 users respond 'yes'.</p>

              <figure class="image-container">
                 <img src="img/Q8.png" alt="Q8" />
              </figure>

              <p>Next, users are required to define an ‘uncomfortable situation’ and this task aids to provide more
                 meaningful context to the research. 83.3% of the participants define such circumstances as being
                 pressured by a member of preferred sex (MPS) despite being refused. 76.7% of the participants also
                find being followed by a stranger to be an uncomfortable situation. Not only that, being touched without
                 consent and unwanted communications with an MPS while being alone garnered a high response rate (73.3%)
                 as well. Shockingly, when the users are asked about whether they have experienced at least one of the
                 aforementioned ‘uncomfortable situations’, 90% ticked “yes”. </p>


                <figure class="image-container">
                   <img src="img/Q10.png" alt="Q10" />
                </figure>

                <p>In order to save themselves from such circumstances, 36.7% of the users resort to calling a third party and 30% would attempt to run away.
                  However, 28 out of 30 participants agree that technology is viable as a means of escape as it enables the users to get help from family and
                  friends in an efficient and timely manner via calls and texts. As such, 90% of users identify phone calls as the most reliable method to combat
                  against uncomfortable situations, followed by location sharing (60%) and texts (53%). </p>

                  </figure>

                  <p>Apart from these, more than half of the users are not aware of any existing applications
                    or devices that can help them in such situations and thus, substantiating the need for the
                    creation of a new device - the core purpose of this research. As the majority of the users
                    believe that their safety might be harmed if the perpetrators are aware of their attempts
                    to seek help, a discreet and efficient mechanism is strongly preferred.

                    </figure>

                    <p>Based on this general consensus, two-thirds of the respondents select the notification feature to close contacts,
                    56.7% want an emergency panic button and 53.3% choose an alarm system activated by catch phrase and voice.</p>


            <h3 id="part2-1-3">Contextual Observation</h3>
            <p>Despite the usefulness of interviews, participants may often recall experiences and actions that may be partial-truth in regards to capturing
              precise details of its occurrence. Conducting contextual observation can provide a more accurate and unbiased depiction of the users' behaviour
              when met with the circumstances.</p>

            <figure class="image-container">
               <img src="img/ON40S20.jpg" alt="Observing" />
               <figcaption></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Contextual Observations takes into account the external factors that can influence people's behaviours in regards to environmental,
              temporal and social factors (Tomitsch, 2018). By observing different environments, the derived data can uncover a better understanding
               of a design problem or context as well as gathering design feedback.</p>

               <p>The primary objective of contextual observation is to observe people interaction toward the situation. Specifically, a situation can be uncomfortable
                  because of the interaction between a woman and an MPS. As the cases can occur ubiquitously through a range of external factors, contextual observation
                  is deemed to be a viable methodology for this research.</p>

                  <p>To <strong>prepare</strong> for this methodology:</p>
                  <p ALIGN=CENTER>The observations will take into account the setting of how the user obtain information on safety precautions from external factors such as
                    the experiences of friends, online communities, families and word-of-mouth.</p>

                  <p>For this research, observations are designed unobtrusively to evade any possible interaction that may affect the behaviour of the users.</p>

               <p>Here was the key takeaways.</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Each participant have experienced an uncomfortable situation with an MPS</li>
                  <li>Majority of the participants were not aware of existing safety applications.</li>
                  <li>'Experiences from Friends' were found to be the most dependable in gaining knowledge in regards to the most reliable safety practices and precautions.</li>

               </ul>
               <p>Majority of the questions was intended to encourage the participants to give precedence to their voices towards
                  the problem and it enables me to yield useful interview data.
                  The following are a few of the participant quotes from the conducted interviews:</p>

                  <p>As anonymity and form of consent were prioritised, this has enabled the protection of participants privacy.
                    Majority of the interviews take place where the participants will feel the most comfortable (i.e. their home).
                    Thus enable the creation of a safe space that encourage the participants to freely and openly voice out
                    their feelings, thoughts and experiences even further.</p>
            </ul>


                        <blockquote ALIGN=center>"Everyone I know have experienced it
                          which is pretty f*cked but it's the reality of it." - P3</blockquote>


                        <p>A participant (P3) relies on her girl friends when seeking advice about uncomfortable situation with an MPS. She stated the above quote which perfectly
                          depict on how the problem has ingrained deeply into our culture. It resorts to the proximity
                        of the indecent behaviours women and girls have to face that it has integrated into a daily routine. Majority of the participants involved in the interview
                      are aware of the problem and felt as if they have no choice but to learn to prevent and respond to the problem. </p>

                        <blockquote ALIGN=center>"It can happen any time. it doesn't matter where you are.
                          or during what time or whether you're alone." - P5</blockquote>

                        <p>One of the biggest challenges of 'harassment' and unwanted behaviours is understanding that uncomfortable situations with an MPS involves a range of behaviours.
                        While also taking into considerations behaviour and motives of the cases varies in terms of external factors. </p>

                        <blockquote ALIGN=center>"when you're on the phone, usually like the person won't even approach you.”" - P7</blockquote>

                           <p></p>
                          <p>The participants involve in the interviews stated that calling their friends, or pretending to make a phone call are one of the methods
                          to prevent and respond to an uncomfortable situation with an MPS. They believe that because it creates an assumption that there is a third-party
                        listening.</p>





            <h2 id="part3-2">Personas</h2>

            <p>After synthesizing the interview responses with affinity diagram, the refinement of the integrated information is
              the subsequent section in the process. Methods such as personas are beneficial in refining raw user data
              by modelling users through storytelling. This method encourages the creation of fictional characters or artefacts
               to represent the participants by "...creating variables, finding patterns in those variables and articulating them..."
               (Tomistch, 2018).  </p>
            <h4>Persona 1</h4>

            <p>Amber's persona is based on the concept of gaining information on safety precautions through friends.
            The development of her characteristics is based upon who is the most dependable external factors to seek advice
            on safety precautions when/if someone is experiencing an uncomfortable situation with an MPS. </p>

               <figcaption>Meet Kim</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>While Kim's persona is modeled on the concept of gaining information on safety precautions through gut feeling.
              The precautions refer to informing the subjects of potential threats that may harm an individual
              safety. These feelings are vital when encountered by an uncomfortable situation with an MPS, as the participants
              are able to flee to safety before the situation worsen.</p>

            <h2 id="part3-3">Storyboards</h2>

            <p>Storyboards are utilised to draw the interactions between users and
              product or services visually (Tomitsch, 2018).</p>

              <p>This storyboard entails the visual depiction of one of the personas
                above, Amber, where her persona represents the concept of obtaining
                information on safety precautions through friends.</p>

               </figure>

               <p>Followed by the data gained from both interviews and questionnaires,
                 it is evident that obtaining information from friends are the most
                 reliable when dealing with uncomfortable situations.</p>

            <h1 id="part3-4">Reframing the problem</h1>
            <h2>Archaelogy</h2>
            <p>October 2017, marks the breakthrough in recognising 'sexual harassment' as a national problem. Efforts to perceived sexual harassment as a prominent problem in society is often argued with its prevalence.  Though, in 2017, the allegations on Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has put the harassment of women into the spotlight (Cobb.S & Horeck.T , 2018). For the first time, the topic of 'sexual harassment' gain national attention and has encouraged the creation of the #Metoo movement. The effect has produced the prevalence of uncomfortable situations with an MPS in the public sphere. As women and girls were able to break their silence and share their experiences for the very first time since their victimisation. </p>
              <p>Based on the Australian Bureau of Statistic survey on Personal Safety (2016), One in two women had experienced sexual harassment in the course of their lifetime. To clarify, about half of Australian women have experienced sexual harassment. Girls at the age of 18 to 24 were the worst to be affected by the harassment. The persistence of these severe, pervasive and troublingly harassing behaviours often involves interaction with a Member of Preferred Sex. Unwanted and unwelcome harassment can make a situation with an MPS uncomfortable. It is a problem that is transpiring ubiquitously, regardless of time or location. It enforces girls to resort with excessive precautions of one's safety as a method of prevention(what to look out for) in possible situations while also counter-response(what to do) if the incidents were to occur. </p>

              <p>Throughout the years, the solutions to this problem are barely considered, as society has not deemed it a serious problem. Proving it to be challenging to reach consensus on what should be done. </p>
            <h2>Paradox</h2>
            <p>The core paradox in this situation refers to how 'sexual harassment' is deeply ingrained in our culture. It permeates the lives of women and girls, making the experiences a integrate part of everyday life. However, this presumably does not dictate the prevalence of the problem for the state/society. Here is the paradox to this conundrum:

              <p>"<em>Because</em> harassment is not recognised as unlawful and an offence,  the experience of being harassed has become a routine part of everyday life."</p>

                <p>"<em>Because</em> uncomfortable situations are ingrained deeply into our culture, women and girls could only abbreviate the experiences by learning to prevent and respond to survive."</p>

                <p>"<em>Because</em> preventing and responding is the most viable option, women and girls have to rely on their own and other experiences."

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h2>Themes</h2>
            <p>One major theme that can be drawn into question is <strong><em>how we deal with risk in society</em></strong>. Uncomfortable situations with an MPS pose a risk to women and girls personal safety.</p>

              <p>As stated by Dorst (2015),</p>
              <blockquote ALIGN=center>"people want the state to 'eliminate risk, though, in reality, risk can only be diminished."</blockquote>
                <p> I see many cases of serious sexual harassment where the victim can't get any relief because society hasn't deemed it a serious problem,
                  All women have experienced an uncomfortable situation with an MPS. Women are prone to these risks daily, which enforces further desire for the risks to be eliminated. Though it is crucial to take into account that the nature of its occurrence has no boundaries as it can happen anywhere and any time. This only signifies how impossible it is to remove the problem, as they can only be abbreviated over time. </p>

                  <p>Furthermore, education can be implemented as a second theme which complement dealing with risk. In particular, <em><strong>how do we educate this problem to society</em></strong>. Uncomfortable situations can occur in many different factors.  Implementing education on preventing and responding to uncomfortable situations against an MPS can appoint the lack of safety resources available.</p>
            <h2>Field</h2>
            <p>Preventing a physical attack does not accurately define personal safety. It should be interpreted as protecting our heart, mind, and body from unwanted and threatening situations with a Member of Prefered Sex. </p>

            <p>Specifically, who you seek or give advice to are the major fields in preventing and responding against uncomfortable situation with an MPS. In the social field, friends are one of the star-players girls often go first to seek immediate advice. Friends are the most relatable and reliable, making girl-talk sessions a safe space for girls to talk about their fears and troubles openly and judgement-free. </p>

            <p>Another social field is parents.  Mums and Dads are the first and the best in teaching about personal safety.  Girls often evade from seeking advice to their parents to avoid making them overly worried. It may seem to be the right mindset, but at the end of the day, they are still your parents who genuinely love and care for their children. They can give great advice, parents are the first teachers after all.  </p>

            <p>The field also includes authoritative figures such as police enforcement and regulators. These social fields can be active and passive players in terms of providing presence, assistance, security and regulations in society. <p>

            <h2>Frames</h2>
            <p>By utilising these themes, it allows new frames to generate for the problem. Such as:

If the problem situation of being harassed can be abbreviated by learning to prevent and respond is approached as if its a problem of failing to provide a reliable place for safety resources online, then prevention can be learned from.... interactive signs or devices. </p>

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>As a preliminary design proposal, ideas were developed based on the frame and its need to be reliable for women and girls when seeking advice on safety with an MPS. By creating an interactive installation such as an infographic of the problem to the public can expose the risk and its prevalence. This reflects the theme of education beyond women and girls. </p>


            <h2>Integration</h2>
            <p>Cases of an uncomfortable situation with an MPS will continue to prevail in society. The conduct is ingrained deeply into our culture that it has become normalised for women and girls to experience the indecency in their lifetime.  One of the difficulties in understanding this problem is that it involves a range of behaviours and factors. Which makes it impossible to regulate and identify the perpetrators. However, after articulating the themes, we can begin to see beyond the desire for the state to recognise the prevalence of this problem. Because of this indecent culture, something that cannot be eliminated but can only be abbreviated in time.</p>

            <h1 id="part4">Reflection</h1>
            <p>I think this is an interesting area and scenario research, I for one have experience these situations and never realised
            the proximity of how the problem is ingrained deeply into our culture. The research would be more extensive if there was more time
          to doing this project. 2 weeks is not enough to do this assignment, but I think it highlights the importance to manage your time well in such a
        constraint time. Also, I was not in class during the reframing workshop and that probably has affected the writing of this section. I learnt a lot from
      this assignment and I am looking forward to what UI design can do to help mitigate this problem.  </p>
