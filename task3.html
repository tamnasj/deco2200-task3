                 <p id="paragraph">Personal safety refers to an individual’s ability to engage in their everyday life free from the threat or fear of psychological, emotional, or physical harm from others (Lamplugh, 2018). Personal safety may be at risk anywhere and at any time; <em><strong>“There are always potential dangers around us and often we react to them subconsciously to protect ourselves and others from harm.”</strong></em> (Safety and Health Practitioner, 2017). </p>
                 <br>
                 <p id="paragraph">As young women (18-25) encounter higher instances of physical, sexual and emotional abuse or harassment than women in older age groups (ABS, 2016); and as at April 2018, 90% of young women in Sydney felt unsafe in their city after dark, we decided to focus our research on the safety of young women in situations involving a member of the preferred sex. The system we designed attempts to resolve this problem with an innovative solution that addresses the core user needs we uncovered through extensive user research and testing.</p>

       <h1 id="heading">CHOOSING A CONCEPT</h1>
       <h2 id="heading">DECISION MATRIX</h2>
       <p class="singlecontainer_text" id="paragraph">We performed a decision matrix on our three initial concepts weighing them up against our list of criteria for success. We found that Concept 1: Aware-able was not appropriate because the interface was too simple, and the situations where it can be used is very limited. Concept 3: Girl code was also not chosen because it had too high a risk of being exploited, and from feedback we received, people thought it was just a digitised version of the “ask for Angela” campaign. We decided to go with Concept 2: Better safe than sorry because it was the most valuable, and the most applicable to any situations. It is also our only concept that is preventative rather than responsive, which is important to us as all current existing solutions are responsive (part of the reason they are unsuccessful). </p>

       <h2 id="heading">CONCEPT ITERATION</h2>
       <p class="singlecontainer_text" id="paragraph">However, we discovered that our idea was to some extent not feasible, and was lacking interactions after discussing with our tutor, Brad, and realising our UI was very repetitive when we began prototyping. We iterated on the idea by changing the way users share and view scenarios, making it less gamified (due to the nature of our topic). We also added additional features to increase the amount of interactions the user would have, such as having clickable walkthroughs of scenarios, drag and drop to build their scenario, and profile options. We also made it so that users can engage with each other by commenting on scenarios, and saving each other’s scenarios. We reweighed this refined idea on our decision matrix to reassure us that we had addressed the necessary flaws with our design.</p>

         <p id="paragraph">Our first round of paper prototypes was very rough, so we were able to gain valuable insights which informed our decisions in following prototypes. The first round was difficult creating all our pages and pop ups with paper, as much of our system relies on drag and drop, which was difficult to prototype. We realised after this round that there were significant features and functions we had missed, and so we made many changes to our paper prototype, and did a small testing round following this to clarify the changes we made to the paper prototype.</p></div>

We also struggled with our complex problem area, which made it hard to design a solution that solved this issue. However, we incorporated as much user feedback as we could and attempted at addressing the user needs we uncovered in previous research tasks. We hope that our final design of Better safe than sorry is valuable to users, and that you have enjoyed viewing the design process we took to achieve this.</p>
