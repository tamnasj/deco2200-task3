                 <p id="paragraph">Personal safety refers to an individual’s ability to engage in their everyday life free from the threat or fear of psychological, emotional, or physical harm from others (Lamplugh, 2018). Personal safety may be at risk anywhere and at any time; <em><strong>“There are always potential dangers around us and often we react to them subconsciously to protect ourselves and others from harm.”</strong></em> (Safety and Health Practitioner, 2017). </p>
                 <br>
                 <p id="paragraph">As young women (18-25) encounter higher instances of physical, sexual and emotional abuse or harassment than women in older age groups (ABS, 2016); and as at April 2018, 90% of young women in Sydney felt unsafe in their city after dark, we decided to focus our research on the safety of young women in situations involving a member of the preferred sex. The system we designed attempts to resolve this problem with an innovative solution that addresses the core user needs we uncovered through extensive user research and testing.</p>

       <p class="singlecontainer_text" id="paragraph">We performed a decision matrix on our three initial concepts weighing them up against our list of criteria for success. We found that Concept 1: Aware-able was not appropriate because the interface was too simple, and the situations where it can be used is very limited. Concept 3: Girl code was also not chosen because it had too high a risk of being exploited, and from feedback we received, people thought it was just a digitised version of the “ask for Angela” campaign. We decided to go with Concept 2: Better safe than sorry because it was the most valuable, and the most applicable to any situations. It is also our only concept that is preventative rather than responsive, which is important to us as all current existing solutions are responsive (part of the reason they are unsuccessful). </p>

       <p class="singlecontainer_text" id="paragraph">However, we discovered that our idea was to some extent not feasible, and was lacking interactions after discussing with our tutor, Brad, and realising our UI was very repetitive when we began prototyping. We iterated on the idea by changing the way users share and view scenarios, making it less gamified (due to the nature of our topic). We also added additional features to increase the amount of interactions the user would have, such as having clickable walkthroughs of scenarios, drag and drop to build their scenario, and profile options. We also made it so that users can engage with each other by commenting on scenarios, and saving each other’s scenarios. We reweighed this refined idea on our decision matrix to reassure us that we had addressed the necessary flaws with our design.</p>

                      <p id="paragraph">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
